# Todo Application

## Overview

The **Todo Application** is a web-based tool designed to help users manage their tasks efficiently. Users can create, update, and delete tasks, as well as mark them as completed. The application provides a clean and intuitive user interface that allows users to focus on what matters mostâ€”getting things done.

## Features

- Create new tasks
- Edit existing tasks
- Delete tasks
- Mark tasks as complete or incomplete
- Filter tasks by status (all, completed, incomplete)
- User authentication with JWT
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend:**
  - **React.js** - A JavaScript library for building user interfaces
  - **Tailwind CSS** - A utility-first CSS framework for styling
  - **Axios** - For making HTTP requests to the backend

- **Backend:**
  - **Node.js** - JavaScript runtime for building the server
  - **Express.js** - A web framework for Node.js to handle routing and server logic
  - **MongoDB** - NoSQL database for storing tasks
  - **Mongoose** - ODM library for MongoDB to manage data models
  - **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)** - For user authentication and secure access to the API

## Best Practices

- **Code Organization:** 
  - The codebase is organized into separate folders for components, services, and models to promote clarity and maintainability.

- **Component Reusability:**
  - Components are built with reusability in mind, allowing for easy updates and consistent UI across the application.

- **Responsive Design:**
  - The application is fully responsive, ensuring a smooth user experience on both mobile and desktop devices.

- **Error Handling:**
  - Comprehensive error handling is implemented for both frontend and backend, providing users with clear feedback when issues arise.

- **API Documentation:**
  - The backend API is well-documented, making it easier for other developers to understand how to interact with the server.

- **Authentication Security:**
  - User authentication is secured with JWT, allowing for token-based access control and ensuring that user sessions are managed safely.
